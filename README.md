# Nacht der Untoten

Welcome to the demo of call of duty zombies inspired mod. It is not only a map, but also
a gamemode, in which you'll be fighting to survive through waves of zombies.
Features including:
- Custom enemies
- Wave system
- Power ups
- Perks
- Buying weapons + mystery box
- Barricading windows

Important:
- Yellow levers are for interaction
- Remember to spawn lock ammunition
- Each weapon from the wall can be bought once, so spawnlock that ammunition
- Buy k98k for free before starting the round

### How to play?
When you launch the game, turn 180 degrees to see and select the custom map. Then load it like any other scene.
If you can't see it, or it loads proving grounds, then 90% chances are, you've done something wrong, or there is problem with other mods.
