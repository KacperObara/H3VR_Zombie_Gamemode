# H3VR_Zombie_Gamemode
 Custom mod for a VR game

[Scripts used in this mod](https://github.com/KacperObara/CustomScripts)  



## THIS IS AN EARLY PROTOTYPE

Welcome to the demo of call of duty zombies inspired mod. It is not only a map, but also
a gamemode, in which you'll be fighting to survive through waves of zombies.
Features including:
- Custom enemies
- Wave system
- Buying weapons + mystery box

Important:
- Yellow boxes are for interaction
- Remember to spawn lock ammunition
- Each weapon from the wall can be bought once, so spawnlock that ammunition
- Buy k98k for free before starting the round

The gamemode is in an early state. Currently I'm testing what's possible to create in H3VR, 
for now the map is literally cardboard in the rough shape of the famous bunker.
